# Tomb Raider-Inspired Inventory with CRT Effect

This project features a **PS1-style inventory system** inspired by the original *Tomb Raider* (1996, PSX), combined with a **CRT post-processing effect** to evoke the visuals of classic consoles.

## How It Works

- Items are arranged in a **circular carousel**, each facing outward.
- Navigate between items using the **A** and **D** keys on the keyboard.
- The **selected item rotates continuously** around its Y-axis.
- Press **Q** to enter **Inspect Mode**:
  - In this mode, the camera orbits the item using **W / A / S / D**.
  - Press **Q** again to return to the carousel.
- The **CRT filter** can be toggled at any time using the **checkbox near the title**.

## Why did i choose it?

As someone with a passion for retro gamingâ€”especially from the **PSX and PS2 era**â€”I wanted to recreate the feeling I had when I first played *Tomb Raider* as a kid. Its inventory system stuck with me over the years, and I wanted to replicate that memory. I also added an **Inspect Mode** inspired by *Resident Evil* to let players closely examine items.

I'm also fascinated by **authentic graphics on original hardware**, which is why I included a **CRT effect** as a nod to the era.
